Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System
Overview
This project is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system developed using Python, MySQL, and Toga. The goal is to create a robust and efficient system for managing customer data, user roles, and privileges. This system is designed to be scalable, with additional functionality to be added over time.

Features
Database: The system uses a normalized MySQL database, ensuring data integrity and efficient storage.

Users and Roles: The database includes user accounts and roles, each with specific privileges. This allows for fine-grained access control within the system.
Backend: Python is used for database interaction via Python Connection, handling all CRUD operations and business logic.

Frontend: The user interface is built using Toga, a Python-native, OS-native GUI toolkit. This provides a consistent look and feel across different platforms.
